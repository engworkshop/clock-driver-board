## 1 Prepare PCB

### Step 1.1

Solder the DS3234 clock chip on underside of the PCB. This is fairly easy to do with a fine-tipped [soldering iron and desoldering braid](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/96). No dedicated SMD soldering equipment is needed.

### Step 1.2

Solder male headers for the RP2040 Zero and voltage regulator. Optionally, solder a female header for the motor. If you are making a Mystery Clock or Hollow Clock 4 Remix, do not solder the female header. The motor wires will need to be soldered directly to the PCB in order to fit in the clock base.

### Step 1.3
